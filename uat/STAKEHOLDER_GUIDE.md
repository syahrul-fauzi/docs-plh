# Staging UAT: Stakeholder Guide

**Welcome to the Lawyers Hub Staging Environment!**

This guide will help you test the new features of the Lawyers Hub platform. We are currently in "Staging," which means this is a safe place to test—no real client data is affected.

## 🔑 Accessing the System

*   **URL**: `http://staging.lawyers-hub.internal:3008` (or provided localhost URL)

    *   **Demo Mode** is enabled. You do NOT need a password.
    *   Click "Sign In" and you will be automatically logged in as a Test User.

## 🧪 What to Test

We need your feedback specifically on:

1.  **Creating Cases**: Can you create a new case easily?
2.  **Collaborative Editing**:
    *   Open a document in a case.
    *   Try typing.
    *   (Optional) Open the same URL in a second browser window to see real-time updates.
3.  **Responsiveness**: Does the app feel fast?
